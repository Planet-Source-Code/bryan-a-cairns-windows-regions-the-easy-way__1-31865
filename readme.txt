The layman's guide to windows regions
Bryan Cairns 2002

Windows regions are a pain in the butt for beginners (and some seasoned pros too).

I did a search on PSC and found that there are not many examples of windows regions (other then shaping forms). 
This is a good example of how to make regions and detect mouse states.

This project could be modified to enhance GUIs and make image mappers.

Basically to create a region you need to tell windows what type of region you are making.

Rectangle  = squares, rectangles
Elliptical = circles, ovals
Polygon =  stars, and other odd shapes

Once you have decided what type to make you just need to fill in the blanks

See the sub "DoTest" in form1 to see how to call all these types.
